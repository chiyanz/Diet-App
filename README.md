# DINE
## For HackNYU 2023  

## 💡Inspiration
In a world where our food culture is becoming more and more diverse, it's getting more confusing to find out what goes into making a dish, which leads to higher risk of allergies and breaking dietary restrictions; that's why, with DINE, you can personalize your own culinary recommendations, to create profiles that allow for easy accommodation of your dietary needs, and gain access to a wide range of recipes, all while having the peace of mind by knowing that these foods are safe for you. With DINE, we hope to promote more inclusiveness with dietary accommodations, as well as healthier lifestyles by promoting dining in with smart recommendations that promote delicious and healthy options.

## 🔍What it does
DINE allows users to customize their profiles by declaring their allergies and dietary restrictions through a simple yet effective interface, and search our broad database for nutritious, delicious recipes.  We personalize recommendations for each user based on their dietary needs, and use machine learning algorithms to utilize their past choices for smarter recommendations. 

## ⚙️How we built it
We built this app with JavaScript using Next.js framework, Chakra.UI for styling,  and TensorFlow.js for building machine learning models.   

## 🚧Challenges we ran into
Recommendation systems is a complicated topic, and as we worked to integrate machine learning into our application with beginner data science knowledge, it was difficult to select a sensible model and implementation that works with our goals and is possible to implement given our time restraints.  
 
## 💪Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of a beautiful, minimalistic yet fully functional User Interface that accomplishes our goals. We're proud of ourselves for challenging ourselves to learn technologies (such as Next.js, Chakra and TensorFlow) and having the courage to integrate them into our project.

## 🧑‍🎓What we learned
We've learned that product planning is a complicated and time-intensive process, from ideation to wireframing to user stories. Trying to achieve all the functionalities we wanted in our project really put us tight on time, and it became even more challenging with our goals of using machine learning.

## ❤️What's next for DINE
DINE is hoping to expand beyond recipes, to provide more features for inclusion, and to promote community development. We with to integrate a "social" feature to our application where users can make friends and share their recipes with each other, and we also want to be able to provide even more functionality for users to indicate more detailed preferences, such as dislike of certain foods.
